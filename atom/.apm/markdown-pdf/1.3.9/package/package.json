It will appear in the same directory as the Markdown you are converting, with the same name and a different extension.\n\n![markdown-pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travs/markdown-pdf/master/assets/testpdf.png)\n\nYou can set parameters in the package's settings, such as page size, orientation, and output format (pdf, png or jpeg).\n\n### How it works\n\nThe HTML provided by running the markdown through [marked](https://www.npmjs.org/package/marked) is prepended with the css from the [markdown-preview atom package](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview). The syntax-highlights styling is pulled from the user's currently-active theme and added in the same way.\n\nThis HTML+CSS is then fed to [html-pdf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/html-pdf), which outputs the final image (pdf, png or jpeg) doc.\n\nThe package has dependencies on [tree-view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) and [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview), but since these are included in the default atom installation, you probably won't have to worry about that.\n\n#### Heart it? Hate it?\nFeel free to run `apm star 'markdown-pdf'` or give some feedback :smile:\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf#readme","_id":"markdown-pdf@1.3.9","_shasum":"fc69de67d17343e02c70f9addec35c8ca807d6bc","_resolved":"file:../d-1151115-10189-1jliaag/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151115-10189-1jliaag/package.tgz"}
