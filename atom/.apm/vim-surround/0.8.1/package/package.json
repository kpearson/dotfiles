See\n  [#28](https://github.com/gepoch/vim-surround/issues/28).\n\n### Muscle Memory Compatability Note\n\nvim-surround uses a lowercase `s` instead of `S` for surround commands! This is\nconfigurable in the package settings, if you would like to set it to the\noriginal keybinding.\n\n## How to use Surround\n\n### Surrounding\n\nFor double quotes, highlight the string in visual mode and enter `s \"`.\n\n```\nHello world -> \"Hello world\"\n```\n\nFor parentheses there are two options. `s )` will surround as normal. `s (`\nwill pad with a space. All asymmetrical pairs have the secondary space-padded\nform.\n\nFor example:\n\n`s )`\n\n```\nHello world -> (Hello world)\n```\n\n`s (`\n\n```\nHello world -> ( Hello world )\n```\n\n### Changing Surrounding Pairs\n\nSuppose I want to make double quotes into single quotes. To do this, I should\nput my cursor inside the double quotes in question and enter `c s \" '`\n\n```\n\"Hello world\" -> 'Hello world'\n```\n\n### Deleting Surrounding Pairs\n\nTo delete the single quotes, place your cursor inside of them and enter `d s '`\n\n```\n'Hello world' -> Hello world\n```\n### Configuration\n\nCurrently, the following pairs work out of the box!:\n\n- ()\n- []\n- {}\n- \"\"\n- ''\n\nYou can add to the available pairs in atom's settings, and the commands will\nbe dynamically added to your keybindings.\n\nFor example if I'm working on Jinja templates, and I want to add the ability to\nsurround using `{%` and `%}` I would add this in my settings:\n\n```\n(), [], {}, \"\", '', {%%}\n```\n\nThen:\n\n`s % }`\n\n```\nHello world -> {%Hello world%}\n```\n\n`s { %`\n\n```\nHello world -> {% Hello world %}\n```\n\n### TODO\n\n- [x] Implement deleting surrounding pairs with `d s`\n- [x] Implement changing surrounding pairs with `c s`\n- [ ] Intelligent tag surrounding/deleting/replacing with `s <q>` and friends.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gepoch/vim-surround/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gepoch/vim-surround#readme","_id":"vim-surround@0.8.1","_shasum":"928b1078fb6aa1d68b2fb3802ae2acacb0d96d97","_resolved":"file:../d-1151115-10090-1xrff7c/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151115-10090-1xrff7c/package.tgz"}
